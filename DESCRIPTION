Description: Advanced statistical tools for Bayesian structure learning in undirected graphical models, accommodating continuous, ordinal, discrete, count, and mixed data. It integrates recent advancements in Bayesian graphical models as presented in the literature, including the works of Mohammadi and Wit (2015) <doi:10.1214/14-BA889>, Mohammadi et al. (2021) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.1996377>, Dobra and Mohammadi (2018) <doi:10.1214/18-AOAS1164>, and Mohammadi et al. (2023) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2307.00127>.
