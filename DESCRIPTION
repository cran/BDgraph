Description: Statistical tools for Bayesian structure learning in undirected graphical models for continuous, ordinal/discrete/count, and mixed data. The package is implemented the recent improvements in the Bayesian graphical models' literature, including Mohammadi and Wit (2015) <doi:10.1214/14-BA889>, Mohammadi et al. (2021) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.1996377>, and Dobra and Mohammadi (2018) <doi:10.1214/18-AOAS1164>.
