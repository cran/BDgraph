Description: Statistical tools for Bayesian structure learning in undirected graphical models for continuous, discrete, and mixed data. The package is implemented the recent improvements in the Bayesian graphical models' literature, including Mohammadi and Wit (2015) <doi:10.1214/14-BA889>, Mohammadi et al. (2021) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.1996377>, and Mohammadi and Wit (2019) <doi:10.18637/jss.v089.i03>.
