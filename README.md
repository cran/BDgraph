## Overview

The `R` package **BDgraph** provides statistical tools for Bayesian structure learning for undirected graphical models with *continuous*, *count*, *binary*, and *mixed data*. The package is implemented the recent improvements in the Bayesian graphical models' literature, including [Mohammadi and Wit (2015)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1422468425), [Mohammadi et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2021.1996377), [Mohammadi et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssc.12171), and [Dobra and Mohammadi (2018)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1532743478). Besides, the package contains several functions for simulation and visualization, as well as several multivariate datasets taken from the literature. To speed up the computations, the computationally intensive tasks of the package are implemented in `C++` in parallel using **OpenMP**.
